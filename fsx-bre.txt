    fsxNet Setup Guide for Barren Realms Elite InterBBS League
    ==========================================================

Here's how to connect to the fsxNet Usenet + Games Gateway (21:1/10)

1.

Contact Paul aka Avon at either avon@bbs.nz or 21:1/101 and ask for your
fsxNet node number to be set up at the fsxNet Usenet + Games Gateway
(21:1/10)

Create a new echonode entry in your BBS config for 21:1/10@fsxnet

Use the settings below BUT - change ensure your 'Session Options'
are as follows: agency.bbs.nz:24557 

This address and port number may differ from the usual address and/or port
you connect to for your fsxNet HUB. However the Gateway runs on a different
BinkP server to feed your BBS Usenet News + Games packets compared to your
usual fsxNet echomail / netmail traffic fed from a fsxNet HUB
(21:1/100, 2/100, 3/100, 4/100 or 5/100)

    Be sure to create a filebox that will be used to send your BRE
    game packets to the 21:1/10 HUB. The above example assumes a
    Windows OS and pathing syntax.

    
2.  Install BRE according to the instructions included in the brev988.zip 
    archive.

  
3.  Change to your BRE directory and run BRE IPSETUP to configure your 
    BBS.CFG file.  Or manually edit the one included.
    
    BRE in Zone 21 uses fileboxes to send packets to 21:1/10 so don't bother
    to configue a mailer type for your BBS.CFG else you end up with a 
    bunch of defunct netmail messages in the netmail inbox you specifiy
    when you run the wizard. I suggest you set it to NONE
    
    For example here's the BBS.CFG I set up at Agency BBS
    
    BBS.CFG
    
        Avon
        Agency BBS
        21:1/101
        c:\mystic\echomail\in
        c:\mystic\doors\fakeinbx  <<--not used but needed to state something
        21
        NONE

        
4.  Obtain an updated BRNODES.DAT files from Avon and drop it to your BRE
    directory.

    
5.  Add the following to the RESOURCE.DAT file to ensure recon updates work.

	  ReconUpdate				2
	  OldestRecon				1
	  TimingCheck				1

  
6.  When configuring your bbs software to run BRE, ensure that you use the 
    BRE FULL command to process inbound and outbound game packets.
    
    Set up and run a batch file to move files created by your copy of BRE
    when a game has been played to a filebox you establish for the 21:1/10
    fsxNet games + Usenet HUB
    
    e.g.
    
    c:
    cd\mystic\doors\bre\outbound
    if exist c:\mystic\doors\bre\outbound\*.* move *.* c:\mystic\fbox\21010
    c:
    cd\mystic
    fidopoll.exe 21:1/10
 

7.  Set up a batch file to process incoming BRE files as they arrive in your
    inbound directory.
    
    e.g.
    
    @Echo On
    c:
    cd\mystic\echomail\in
    if exist c:\mystic\echomail\in\021*.* goto bre
    if exist c:\mystic\echomail\in\*.GAL goto galactic
    goto done

    :bre
    c:
    cd\mystic\doors\bre
    bre inbound
    goto done

    :galactic
    c:
    cd\mystic\doors\galactic
    GalacticDynasty.exe maintenance
    goto done

    :done
    exit
 
8.  Add the following lines to your game processing batch file (run it at 
    least once a day (or up to hourly if you want) to keep game packets
    and updates flying around the network.

	  Be sure to edit the paths to reflect your system configuration.

	  c:
	  cd\mystic\doors\bre
	  bre request
	  bre planetary
	  bre scores
	  bre bbsinfo
  
9.  Any questions contact Avon at Agency BBS 21:1/101 or email
