Getting Connected - fsxNet For Honour

=============================================================================

For Honour is an Inter-BBS game coded by the world famous Apam :)
There are a number of BBS connected to fsxNet and involved in the Zone 21
Inter-BBS league. If you would like to join here's what you need to do.

1)

Download the latest version of the game from a fsxNet BBS that carries the 
FSX_DOOR file base echo.

The file you want to grab is either FHNRWIN.ZIP (Windows 32 bit version) or
FHNRSRC.ZIP (Source) if you want to compile it for your Linux system

2) 

Contact Paul aka Avon at either avon@bbs.nz or 21:1/101 and ask for your
fsxNet node number to be set up at the fsxNet Games + Usenet Gateway (21:1/10)

3) 

Create a new echonode entry in your BBS config for 21:1/10@fsxnet

Use the settings below BUT - change ensure your 'Session Options'
are as follows: agency.bbs.nz:24557 

This address and port number may differ from the usual address and/or port
you connect to for your fsxNet HUB. However the Gateway runs on a different
BinkP server to feed your BBS Games + Usenet News compared to your usual
fsxNet echomail / netmail traffic fed from a fsxNet HUB (21:1/100, 2/100
3/100 or 4/100)

It's important to enable Filebox and to set the path to a directory you
will be using to send your game packets to the 21:1/10 HUB with.

4)

Unzip and install the For Honour files in to a directory you plan to run
the game from. Compile the Linux version as per the instructions contained
in the .ZIP

** This walkthough assumes a Windows install but you can modify paths etc.
as required **

5)

Edit the fh.ini file to add the specific details about your BBS, node 
number, etc. to it. This is the example from Agency BBS with comments.

[Main]
Log Path = c:\doors\fh\logs          <--- Set path for log files
Bad Path = c:\doors\fh\bad           <--- Set path for bad packets received
Delete Bad = False                   <--- Set 'False' to move bad packets to 
                                          Bad Path or set 'True' to delete
                                          bad packets received at your BBS
Max Fights = 20                      <--- Set this to 20                                          

[Interbbs]
Enabled = true                       <--- Set to True or no Inter-BBS 4 u!
System Name = Agency BBS             <--- Your BBS name
League Number = 21                   <--- Set this to 21
Node Number = 2                      <--- Refer to FH-IBBS.CFG for your node#
File Inbox = c:\mystic\echomail\in   <--- Points to your BBS inbound dir
Default Outbox = c:\mystic\filebox\fsxnet <-- Outbound Filebox defined earlier

Note: The node number (4th line in Interbbs settings) is not your regular
fsxNet node number. It's the number assigned to you by the League Coordinator
and can be found in the FH-IBBS.CFG file that will be sent to you by the 
Coordinator once your node is set up at 21:1/10

6)

Obtain an updated FH-IBBS.CFG file from the League Coordinator and place
this file in your For Honour working directory.

7)

Set up a menu option to run your game. Here's the example from Agency BBS

Display Text  │ 1 - For Honour (fsxNet)
LightBar Low  │ 1
LightBar High │ 1
Hot Key       │ 1
Access        │ s20                                Up    │ 0   Escape │ 0
Display Type  │ Access                             Down  │ 0   Tab    │ 0
X Y           │ 0  0                               Left  │ 0   PageUp │ 0
Timer         │ 0                                  Right │ 0   PageDn │ 0
Timer Type    │ Interval      Redraw │ Yes         Home  │ 0   End    │ 0
Command ────────────────── Access ───── Data ─────────────────────────────
(D3) Exec DOOR32 program             c:\doors\fh\start.bat %Pdoor32.sys %3 %0

The contents of start.bat looks like this

c:
cd\doors\fh
ForHonour.exe %1 -N %2 -SOCKET %3
ForHonour.exe maintenance
cd\mystic
mis poll 21:1/10
goto done

:done

8)

Set up regular event to process incoming game packets from the 21:1/10
You may want to have a timed event to run this processing a few times 
a day. Or you might like to have a batch file that runs each time 
any packets etc. arrive in your inbound directory.

e.g. fhmaint.bat

c:
cd\doors\fh
ForHonour.exe maintenance
goto done

:done

 
9)

Review the For Honour Readme file that ships with the game
files. It contains a good overview of the setup of the game and also
details of how to customise your score files if displaying them on
your BBS.

10)

Got further questions? Be sure to post them in fsxNet and someone
who is already running this game will be able to help you :)
