The following echomail areas have been retired and any BBS linked to
these echos have been delinked at their respective fsxNet HUBs. 
You may wish to remove these message bases from your BBS.

FSX_PKT - Packet Radio (AX.25 Gateway). This was a read-only echo fed by a 
          gateway operated by LU9DCE. His system has closed down and the 
          echo has been shuttered.
          
FSX_ESP - Español General Chat. This echoarea was for Spanish language
          conversations. It was largely spun up to help nodes setting up
          in NET 5 (ARG) but did not come to much. Now NET 5 has closed
          with LU9DCE closing down this echo has been shuttered for now.

                 echomail areas will be shuttered in the coming days. An 
                 announcement about those message areas will follow in the

Created three new echomail areas:

FSX_HAM - Amateur Radio discussions. Covers all aspects of HAM radio
          including DX, HF, VHF/UHF, various digital modes etc.
          
FSX_PKT - Packet Radio (AX.25 Gateway). This is a *read-only* echoarea that
          carries gated international AX.25 packet radio bulletins from
          the amateur radio scene. These messages may be of interest to 
          both amateur radio operator and the general public.
          The gateway is operated by LU9DCE
          
FSX_ESP - Español General Chat. This echoarea offers a place for Spanish
          language conversations. Like FSX_GEN it is a general discussion
          echoarea covering many topics. Test messages and other
          experimentation is welcome.
          
          Este echoarea ofrece un lugar para conversaciones en español.
          Al igual que FSX_GEN, es una discusión general que abarca muchos
          temas. Mensajes de prueba y otros experimentos son bienvenidos.

fsxNet Nodelist Housekeeping - NET 1

The following NET 1 systems have been flagged for potential deletion due to
inactivity for some time (weeks or in some cases months!) I will attempt
to contact each sysop and hope to hear back from them within the next seven
(7) days else they risk removal from the nodelist. 

For now the following systems have been marked as 'Down' in the nodelist:

21:1/ 137, 139, 140, 144, 164, 165, 174, 176, 180

A further review of the above nodes will occur in the coming week.

Created FSX_DAT  InterBBS Data. An echomail area used by software such as
                 InterBBS Oneliner or Double-Up (both by Darryl Perry) to
                 send inter-BBS data between nodes in fsxNet. In most cases
                 the data is not readable or of interest to human eyes.
                 Sysops may wish to hide this echo from BBS users.

Mystic BBS turns 20 years young!

I just wanted to note the efforts of author James Coyle aka g00r00 who today
posted in fsx_mys his thanks for everyones interest and involvement in his
Mystic BBS project that has been running for the last 20 years. Think on 
that for a moment - 20 years!

It's no mean feat to sustain an interest in something for so long and 
continue to develop it with the same levels of passion and excitement that
first spurred the interest to do so all those years ago.

For me coming back in to the BBSing scene around 2013 and coming across Mystic
was a welcome sign to me that the scene was not dead and that there was much
fun to be had with the old hobby/interest that I had last dabbled in in
back in 1994.

In 2017 there are a number of BBS platforms under active development. We're
lucky to have a bunch of talented people active in fsxNet who continue to
contribute their skills and passions to the vibrancy of the BBS scene
by creating new BBS software, doors, utils, ANSI art etc. 

James is certainly one of those people. On behalf of all of the users,
sysops, tinkerers, wannabe coders, debuggers who love to test and find 
stuff that may be broken (or not :)) and everyone in between playing in the
BBS scene. Thank you James for you continued contribution to our collectively
enjoyed hobby, it's really appreciated.
 

Updates to HUBs 1/100 2/100 3/100

Today I have been working on updating the software on all fsxNet HUBS active
at present. They are now all in sync and use the same version of Mystic BBS.
Which at the time of writing this is 1.12 A37 pre-alpa version 2017/12/13

At the same time of doing these updates I have changed the way netmail is 
routed between the HUBs. In short the rules to deliver netmail between NETs
has been updated to prevent a circular loop occurring where undeliverable 
netmail could end up bouncing between various NETs. I have also established
direct links between NET 2 and NET 3 to speed up delivery of netmail where as
before this, all netmail between NET 2 and NET 3 was routed via NET 1

I am now also starting to look at establishing a NET 4 to accommodate ongoing
growth experienced with new nodes joining fsxNet. The thinking being not
wanting to have HUB with large numbers of nodes (70+) attached and instead 
add more HUBs serving smaller numbers (30-40) of nodes. If we do opt to fully 
mesh all the HUBs for echomail traffic, whilst it would generate a fair 
amount of DUPE traffic between the HUBs it would also help to build greater
redundancy and resilience across the wider fsxNet. Well that's what I think 
would happen - but you're feedback and thoughts are most welcome :)   

Welcome new nodes :)

Updated Node 1/197 Titian's Orbit BBS (BRA) Flavio has been in contact and
                   polled 1/100 so his system is no longer marked as 'Down'

Added Node   1/116 sOUNDGARDEn (NLD) Welcome to Marco Reparon aka sPINOZa
                   who is running a private system for now. sPINOZa has been
                   using Mystic on/off since the early 2000s and is having
                   another look at the platform. Welcome :)

Updated Node 1/136 force9 BBS (GBR) Dave is now contactable via BinkP polling
                   I have removed the 'Down' status against his nodelist 
                   entry. Welcome back force9 :)

fsxNet Nodelist Housekeeping (continued)

More twists and turns in this episode of 'know your ever changing
nodelist' :)

Added Node 1/136   force9 BBS (GBR) Dave has contacted me. He is away on 
                   holiday but plans to look in to any issues with his BBS 
                   when he gets back. He confirms he does not want to be 
                   deleted. So I have re-instated his node number.
                   Hopefully we can get packets flowing again in the coming
                   weeks. Look for his test posts :)
 
Added Node 1/180   Logon BBS (GER) Oliver has also been in touch and is 
                   working on getting his Raspberry Pi back up and running 
                   again. He has some Internet issues by the sounds of it but
                   is working on things over the coming weeks. Also look for
                   his test messages when he's back up :)
                   I have reinstated his node number.                   
                   
Removed Node 1/168 The Egregore BBS (USA) Luke and I have been chatting via
                   email. He did get in touch amd planned to re-setup his 
                   VM of the BBS. I followed up a few days later and he's
                   advised he can't find his VM! So for now he's asked to be
                   removed. I have delisted his node number.
                   
2017-09-09
fsxNet Nodelist Housekeeping

I have begun to prune the nodelist after waiting a week to gauge replies and
responses to my attempts to contact nodes flagged for attention on Sept 2nd.

Some systems have contacted me and I am working with them to try and sorts
any issues. Others have been silent so they are being pruned from the 
nodelist for now. 

They are (as always) welcome to re-apply and rejoin but I am not going to
store traffic at 21:1/100 for a node that may reappear or may not.


Removed Node 1/167 SilentShard BBS (NZL) Nick has contacted me and confirmed 
                   his system is down for now. He may reapply again in the
                   future when he has more time to run a system.
                   
Removed Node 1/136 force9 BBS (GBR) No reply from Dave to hailing freqs so
                   have removed his system from the nodelist. Attempts to
                   telnet to last known address have also failed. :(
                   
Removed Node 1/155 Gerlach BBS (SVK) Dominik advises he's time poor and
                   unable to maintain his system and has asked to be 
                   removed from the nodelist.
                   
Removed Node 1/142 SmokyThing BBS (USA) there has been no contact with 
                   Shannon despite best attempts to reach him. So his 
                   system is being removed from the nodelist.

Removed Node 1/144 Aloryn Avalon BBS (USA) there has been no contact with 
                   Joshua despite best attempts to reach him. His system
                   has been removed from the nodelist.

Removed Node 1/150 Southend BBS (Denmark) I have not heard from Lars in 
                   sometime. The last contact was months ago and at that 
                   stage there was talk of a hospital visit. I hope he is
                   well. I have tried to contact him and poll his system
                   but have struck out on both counts. His node has been
                   delisted.

Removed Node 1/164 Beyond Systems BBS (SWE) there has been no reply from
                   attempts to contact Mattias and no connections via
                   telnet to the BBS's last known address. The node has 
                   been delisted.

Removed Node 1/171 Phaseshift BBS (CAN) there has been no reply from attempts
                   to contact Kevin and there is no reply from his BBS when
                   trying to connect to it. The node has been delisted.

Removed Node 1/180 Logon BBS (GER) Farewell to Oliver Bachmann whose system
                   is down and no longer contactable. Node has been delisted.
                   

Removed Node 1/183 Night Owl BBS (USA) attempts to reach Jon have not proved
                   to be successful and there is no reply from his BBS at the
                   last known ddns.net domain name. Node has been delisted.

There are still some nodes I am chasing up to confirm if they are going to
reconnect to fsxNet or if the sysop is not going to do anything soon to do so.
Some may still be removed if a firm track of proposed activity is not
demonstrated in a timely fashion.

I am also working to identify a few nodes that I know are running and polling
1/100 correctly but for some reason(s) their known domain names are not 
resolving and allow the HUB to poll them. I'll write about that in a separate
update when this round of NET 1 nodelist admin concludes.
                   
2017-09-02
fsxNet Nodelist Housekeeping

The following NET 1 systems have been flagged for potential deletion due to
inactivity for some time (weeks or in some cases months!) I have attempted
to contact each sysop and hope to hear back from them within the next seven
(7) days else they risk removal from the nodelist. 

For now the following systems have been marked as 'Down' in the nodelist:

21:1/ 135, 136, 139, 140, 142, 144, 150, 155, 164, 167, 168, 171, 177, 180,
      183, 190, 197

A further review of the above nodes will occur one week from today.

fsxNet Nodelist Housekeeping

Over the coming weeks I will be doing some work on the nodelist. I want to 
ensure it's still current and accurate. Whilst I believe this to be the case
(for the most part) I am fairly confident we have a few dead nodes that need
to be marked as 'Down' and the removed if no longer active or responding to
attempts to contact the sysop. I'll keep you posted on this housekeeping as
I progress it. Of course if your system is active and polling a HUB then you
really have nothing to worry about :)  
                   
2017-06-02

                   indefinitely so sadly 1/110 is no more. I hope Alan

Created FSX_BBS -  BBS software development and support. This echoarea also 
                   hosts fsxNet Wiki (wiki.bbs.geek.nz) discussions and
                   support.
                   
                   With the creation of the fsxNet Wiki it seems appropriate
                   to have a public space to discuss ideas for possible new 
                   Wiki content, edits to current content, editor requests, 
                   questions about what is on the Wiki etc. My hope is that
                   as the content on the Wiki grows, this echo area will
                   support that growth as a place for discussions about it.
                    
                   A reminder that there was an orignal FSX_BBS created
                   as a file echo. It was changed to FSX_SOFT on 2016-09-10 
                   as part of a renaming convention to decern between message
                   base echoarea tags and file base tags file area tags are
                   always four characters long where as message tags are
                   three. e.g. FSX_BBS vs FSX_SOFT

                   Who said you didn't learn anything when you read these
                   updates :) .. and no lamas were harmed in the making of
                   this documentary.

Created fsxNet Wiki The goal of the fsxNet Wiki is to support the development
                    of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS). It does so by hosting
                    useful resources and information for both BBS developers
                    and users alike.

                    It's hoped the Wiki will become a useful resource for
                    all people interested in the BBS scene, and offer helpful
                    information and links that will assist them with any
                    questions they might have.

Comment -          These lines contains no useful information at all but I 
                   figured I would just write something 'just because'. Still
                   feeling guttered they killed off Han Solo. My wife says
                   "move on Paul" :) Perhaps this is a way of working through
                   the grief! Ha! 
                   
                   Kids keep saying to me "Dad, what's 9+10?" Then they say 
                   "21" ... and I say, "no it's 19" and they laugh :) I think
                   I will always correct them (insert OCD applause here :))
                   and they know I will always be be an easy target for them

## Happy New Year - Best wishes for 2017 and your BBSing adventures ahead ##

Created - NET 2 -  The start of a creating new access points for fsxNet
                   traffic. New nodes to the network will be added to NET 2
                   which is now served by a new HUB at 21:2/100
                  
Created - HUB 2 -  The Tholian HUB has been established at 21:2/100.
                   This new HUB will serve nodes in NET 2. Big thanks to 
                   Solaris at Error 404 for establishing this new Mystic
                   powered system :)  The HUB can be found at
                   error404bbs.ddns.net:24555

Updated - fsxNet Nodelist 

I've made some changes to the nodelist that reflect the addition of the new
NET and HUB. Instead of creating new 'Regions' I have opted to stick with one
for now (Region 21 - was Region 1).

I have also revised things and now assigned 'Host' notation to the what are
now NET 1 and 2. They fly the 21:1/0 and 21:2/0 AKA's held by each net
coordinator. HUB addresseing remains as 21:xx/100 and HUBs send/recieve 
all traffic with CRASH priority between them as echomail etc. is generated
around fsxNet. So HUBs fly at /0 and /100 AKA's for their respective NETs.

Also changed is the flag notation used against each node in the nodelist.
I have tried to ensure flags used are current and comply with the Fidonet
Technical Standards Committee document FTSC-5001. Copies of this document
are available from http://www.ftsc.org/docs/ if you are interested :)

Further, the epiloge in the nodelist has been paired right back to remove the
unwanted and/or non-relevant nodelist flags. A brief nod to the URL mentioned
above remains for interested sysops etc. if they want more info.

Updated - HISTORY.TXT - notation tweaks.

I am working to keep this document as easy to read as I can and due to the
new NET (and more to come) I have made minor changes to layout and notation
of this file and will do so in the future. You'll see this in new nodes
being added, removed etc.

2016-12-08
Removed - Node 5 - Opted to delist this system as it will only ever talk with
                   /10 and does not need it's own node listing.
                   
Updated - Node 10 - Now referred to as the Usenet Gateway. Allows fsxNet
                    nodes that want access to a bi-directional FTN<>NNTP
                    gateway for offering Usenet newsgroups on their BBS.
                    
                    I know it's word semantics but I think it's better to
                    get the naming correct for the future. I want to avoid
                    confusion when using words like HUBs etc.
2016-12-07
Added - Node 10  - fsxNet Usenet HUB has been established to service fsxNet
                   nodes that wish to access a bi-directional FTN<>NNTP
                   gateway for offering Usenet newsgroups. It's prede
                   
Added - Node 5   - fsxNet Usenet Gateway. This is a private node with a sole
                   function of handling FTN<>NNTP between news.bbs.geek.nz
                   and 21:1/10                    

Removed - Node 140 Underland BBS (AUS) Apam has ceased using this system
                   and is opting to focus his efforts on his MagickaBBS
                   system at 21:1/125
                   
Removed - Region 2 - Usenet
Removed - Node 100 - Usenet HUB
Removed - Node 101 - Agency BBS

I was experimenting with using region 2 as a means to distribute Usenet
newsgroups to nodes that want a bi-directional FTN<>NNTP gateway.
Using 21:2/xxx addresses have now been retired in favour of using 
21:1/xxx addresses. It makes it easier for all at present to run things
this way.

Updated - FSXNET.TXT now contains a new section in the application form for
new members to provide their static ipv4 and/or ipv6 addresses (if they
have one) when signing up. This will allow their nodes to be whitelisted
at the fsxNet HUB and avoid any auto-banning that can take place from time
to time as frequent polling (4-5 times in 120 secs) of the HUB may cause.

                   Germany and is learning about BBS and how to set one up.
                   Look for some posts from him when he gets his system
                   configured. I think the plan is to try setting up Mystic
                   BBS. I've listed him as a private node for now until he
                   has a BinkP server up and running.

Added - Node 173 - Added Sinclair Retro BBS (ITA) to the Usenet HUB
                   as 21:2/173 and now feeding a variety of retro computing
                   newsgroups to Outsoft.

Removed - GOODIP.TXT - I can see how this is going to get out of date quite
                    quickly for systems that are using a dynamic IP address.
                    I think for now I am going to remove the list from the
                    infopack. I think it's a good idea but I need to think 
                    through how to best implement it in a way that ensures 
                    it's current. I just don't have the time to maintain it
                    manually.

Created - GOODIP.TXT - this is a file that contains a list of known IP
addresses built from a recent fsxNet nodelist. It was created by sysop
Brian Wallace (bcw142) of Mystic Pi BBS. This list is subject to change
as the nodelist is updated etc. Your milage may vary. The list may / may not
stay in the infopack forever but let's see how we go ;)

Changed - NEWS.TXT - this is a news file that carrys info about
changes to fsxNet. It is used by the fsxnet MPL script written by Xqtr.
The contents of this file are displayed to users who login to a member BBS
that run the script. The NEWS.TXT file is updated most weeks before the 
latest fsxNet infopack is hatched out.

Renamed - FSX_ART to FSX_ARTS - ANSI Art - Groups, Individuals etc.
Renamed - FSX_BBS to FSX_SOFT - BBS Software (Current + Legacy)

Two of the file bases have been renamed to accomodate a new standardised 
naming convention I am applying to fsxNet.

All message echoareas will use a FSX_XXX convention while all file bases
carried by the NET will use a FSX_XXXX style of tag.

The thinking here is to make it simple to spot a file base tag from a
echoarea/ message base tags. I also wanted to pull some current FSX_XXX
tags off their currently assigned file bases should we end up using them
for echoareas in the future.

So - if you are carrying one (or both) of the following file areas can you
please ammend the EchoTag for each in your BBS setup as follows.

FSX_ART to FSX_ARTS 
FSX_BBS to FSX_SOFT

No files will be hatched to these areas until Saturday 17 September (NZST)
this gives folks a week (at minimum) to update their tags / settings. 


Created - FSX_CRY - Cryptographic discussion and experimentation.
                    Public key sharing, encoded messages, testing etc.
                    is welcome here. 

An area of interest for some members of the NET. This is a place to
further this type of discussion and experimentation. 

Created - NEWS.TXT - this is a news file that will carry info about
changes to fsxNet and is intended for future use as part of another
project that's underway. Details to come when there is more to share.

Added - Node 168 - The Egregore BBS (USA). A big hello and welcome to another
                   sysop setting up with Mystic and using Ubuntu Linux.
                   Luke Galutia (Betzelel) is based in Oklhoma City in the
                   USA. He is just working out how to configure his system
                   and get hooked up to this NET. Please make him welcome and
                   dazzle him also with your BBS helpfulness :)

                   SysOp Nick Trevena (ThatGuy). Nick is setting up a
                   Mystic BBS under Ubuntu Linux and is going to show his son

                   BBS scene Nick :)
                   
2016-09-04
Two new echoarea have been added to fsxNet. All nodes have been connected to
them by default but feel free to delink if you don't want this traffic.
The infopack has been updated with new echoarea details.

Created - FSX_MYS - Mystic BBS discussions, support and development.
         
Created - FSX_BOT - The first choice for non-human roBOT output. 
              May contain BBS and NET ads, stats reports, telemetry reports,
              traces of nuts etc. Set your BOT free in this area :)

2016-09-02
Removed - FSX_NETS - BBS Networks, Infopacks, Nodelists file base.
Renamed - FSX_NODE - Weekly Nodelists (fsxNet, etc.)
Renamed - FSX_INFO - Weekly Infopacks (fsxNet, etc.)

I am starting to cut down and rationalise some of the file areas on the NET.
Contents posted to this area will be migrated to FSX_INFO and FSX_NODE so that
both of those file bases carry not just fsxNet infopacks and nodelists but
also the equivalent files for other NETs. I figure this is a smarter way to
use the file bases. And I really want to support other NETs.
 
The added upside of this is that if you are using Mystic to import nodelists
for a [MergeNodelists] MUTIL activity then you can start to point all of your
nodefile=\path\to\nodelist statements to the same file base :)

Update - Usenet Newsgroups

I'm experimenting with using net 2 as a means to distribute Usenet
newsgroups to nodes that want a bi-directional FTN<>NNTP gateway.
Using 21:2/xxx addresses may be the way to do this. Have addded some new
nodes to help with testing that will start soon. Still a work in progress.

Added - Node 110 - Rusty Mailbox BBS
Added - Node 122 - Necronomicon BBS
Added - Node 165 - Miskatonic BBS


Added - Node - 166 - Datanet BBS (AUS) Welcome from Melbourne, Australia to
                     Steve Ellis aka rEApz :) rEApZ is running a Mystic BBS
                     under Debian Linux and is returning to the BBS scene.
                     He was last active in the 90's and is now mucking around
                     (his words) with echomail etc. and having fun.
                     Welcome rEApZ, nice to have you in the NET + bolstering
                     the Australian membership. I think the Aussies have 
                     caught up with the Kiwis now :)
                     
Changed - Node 129 - SpaceSST BBS (CAN) Luc has advised he has major hardware
                     problems and has no time at present to rebuild his system
                     nor will not invest money in hardware to fix it.
                     So I have marked his system as DOWN for now and made his
                     node inactive. Let's see if he returns or not?

Revised - file_id.diz

I am having some issues processing infopack hatching when I include the
ASCII artwork kindly donated by RiPuk. Until I nail down the niggles I've 
reverted to the older file_id.diz for ASCII but have included the .ans
version also should systems choose to use it.

Added - Node 165 - Miskatonic BBS (ITA). As I write this Italy has just been
                   hit by a magnitude 6.2 earthquake. I was deeply worried for

                   that amazing country to join the NET. I'm glad to report
                   he's OK. Phew. Antonio is based in Grosseto and using a 
                   Mystic BBS system on a Raspberry Pi. He's very keen on 
                   retro stuff and we're very happy to have him as part of the
                   community - welcome :)
