               The [F]un, [S]imple, e[X]perimental Network
               ===========================================

                    (Est. 2015 | Zone 21 | fsxnet.nz)
 
fsxNet is a fun, simple and experimental network established in late 2015

fsxNet is not a prescriptive network. e[X]perimentation is at heart
of its name and members are actively encouraged to be creative in their
use of the network. A limited number of message areas and file bases are
used - setup is quick and [S]imple.

Technologies covered by the network include (but are not limited to)
BBSing, ANSI art, Amateur (HAM) Radio, Retro / Vintage Computers & Gaming,
FTN communications, network protocols & topologies, encryption methods,
contemporary computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi), computer coding and more.

fsxNet sees a number of messages posted to it every week. It is an
active support network for several developers of BBS software spanning
BBS systems, door games and more.

fsxNet is not an invite-only closed network, rather it is an open 
community and everyone who wishes to join is welcome.

Do you find it [F]un to learn about and use retro computing technologies?
Would you like to be part of a group that enjoy experimenting and developing
those technologies further? If the answer is yes, then we invite you to 
join us :) 

== Goals ====================================================================

Develop and encourage international communications between 100 (or more)
geographically diverse bulletin board system operators (members)
and their users in order to:

- Support and create learning and experimental opportunities 
- Explore and develop new and interesting methods of online communication
- Foster international friendships without borders
- Raise awareness of BBS as a hobby and communications option for
  the 21st century

== Values ===================================================================

- Have fun!
- Keep it simple
- Be kind, respectful and helpful
- Reject disruptive conduct that willfully incites discord

== Housekeeping =============================================================

Members of fsxNet and their users will conduct themselves according to the
goals and values of fsxNet. Failure to do so risks members being de-listed
and/or removed by the Network Coordinator

Please don't post echomail to fsxNet about country politics or religion. 
These subjects inevitably seem to cause discord and are best left for
discussion on other message networks. 

The use of the fsxNet for illegal purposes is not permitted. Members or users
deemed to be engaged in such activities will be de-listed and/or removed by
the Network Coordinator

Members real names are used in the nodelist, members and users aliases or
real names are welcome in all echoareas

Messages containing ANSI should use a [ANSI] prefix in the message subject
line. This allows members who can not view ANSI content to opt out reading it
if they are unable to do so. e.g. Subject: [ANSI] Something I drew last night
  
Please do not gate fsxNet traffic to other FTN/QWK networks, Usenet, 
or any other network without first discussing your request in FSX_GEN
and obtaining approval from the Zone 21 ZC. 
 
== Echoareas ================================================================

== Technical Details ========================================================

**** IMPORTANT DETAILS - PLEASE NOTE ****

There are currently five NETs operating in fsxNet each serviced by a HUB.

The fsxNet WHQ HUB (21:1/100) accepts BinkD connections via 
net1.fsxnet.nz:24554

The fsxNet Tholian HUB (21:2/100) accepts BinkD connections via 
net2.fsxnet.nz:24555 or port 24553 (SSL)

The fsxNet Mutura HUB (21:3/100) accepts Telnet EMSI/FTS6 + ZedZap
connections via net3.fsxnet.nz:60177 and BinkD connections on 24554 
or port 24553 (SSL)

The fsxNet Niba HUB (21:4/100) accepts BinkD connections via 
net4.fsxnet.nz:24560 or port 24553 (SSL)

The fsxNet Omicron HUB (21:5/100) accepts VMODEM NetSerial/PXW connections
via net5.fsxnet.nz:3141

Please note the port numbers we're using are in a range from 24553 - 24560
subject to which HUB you are polling.

Please also note when you receive your node number it may likely be in
a different NET than NET 1 so you will possibly need to change both your NET
and NODE number when you obtain your fsxNet address. Along with changing some
address details and session password for the HUB system your BBS is allocated
to poll.

If you are running Mystic BBS please add the IP address 219.89.83.33 and
2001:470:d:123::50 to the WHITELIST.TXT file in your Mystic BBS data 
directory. These are the known IP addresses for the fsxNet HUB in NET1
You may want to add further addresses for other HUBs you connect to in
fsxNet (or othernets / bbs systems) also. You can access this feature via
a text editor from the Mystic configuration menus by typing 
MYSTIC -CFG > Servers > Edit IP Whitelist

Taking this steps ensures that when a fsxNet HUB polls your system it will not
be auto blocked by your Mystic Internet Server if it polls your system 
frequently.

We encourage you to apply for your own node number to obtain full access to 
all available fsxNet echomail areas :)

For anything that's not applicable below, please state "NA".
Thanks for your interest.

An infopack is always available from fsxnet.nz/fsxnet.zip or 
bbs.nz/fsxnet.zip or Agency BBS.

        fsxNet - [F]un, [S]imple, e[X]perimental Network - Application

Please complete as best as you can. If unsure or not applicable just
state this in your reply :)  If you don't run a BBS, just state a system name
you will be known by. 

By completing this application you:

- Agree to abide by the fsxNet goals, values and housekeeping items detailed 
in this document. 

- Consent to the ZC and HUB administrators holding/using the information 
supplied by you for the purposes of joining and administering the fsxNet 
network. 

- Consent to your your name, city and country details appearing in the
fsxNet nodelist and systems.txt file . These files list all participating
BBS and sysops that are active in fsxNet.

- Agree to notify your fsxNet HUB admin when you decide to leave the network.
This ensures HUBs don't hold files/messages for your system long after you
have left fsxNet. 

Thank you for your interest!
        
 Real Name.....................:
 Alias/AKA (if any)............:
 City / Country................:
 BBS / System Name.............:

Notes:

* Password must be a maximum of 8 UPPERCASE characters using A-Z and 0-9

* If you use non standard Telnet, SSH or BinkP ports please state them above

* CRASH traffic means files/message packets will be pushed to your BinkP 
  server by your HUB when they arrive at the HUB. HOLD traffic means the HUB
  will hold on to your files/packets until your BBS polls the HUB to collect
  them when you are ready.

* Regardless of HUB traffic option chosen please ensure your BBS polls its 
  fsxNet HUB hourly (at a minimum once daily). This ensures if the HUB can't
  reach your BBS you can reach it to collect your files/ message packets etc.


Do you have a static IPv4 and/or IPv6 address? 

If yes, please state the details below. This will help ensure your node is
whitelisted and not auto-blocked by a fsxNet HUB due to any frequent polling
by your BBS. (e.g. 3-4 times in 1 minute) 

 My Static IPv4 Address is:

 My Static IPv6 Address is:
 
If you have a static IP address would you like an optional custom fsxnet.nz
domain name that will resolve to your IP? e.g. mybbsname.fsxnet.nz 

If yes, please state your preferred domain below. 

Please assign my BBS:  ________________.fsxnet.nz
